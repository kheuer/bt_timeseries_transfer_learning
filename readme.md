# Is incorporating data from various sources beneficial for time series predictions on stock prices using neural forecast methods?

In this thesis, we investigate the impact of incorporating data from various distributions on
forecasting accuracy on stock prices using neural forecast methods. Our study primarily
investigates the application of transfer learning in time series forecasting to facilitate stock
market price predictions. We have trained several models, built up using distinct archi-
tectures and enriched with differing data including weather and traffic based time series
data. We compare them to the baseline models ARIMA and TimeGPT. In this fashion, we
conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning and a comprehensive analysis of model perfor-
mance based on various metrics. Key findings give insights into the benefits and limitations
of integrating diverse data sources in predictive modeling for financial time series.
